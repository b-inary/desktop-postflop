# Desktop Postflop

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **As of October 2023, I have started developing a poker solver as a business and have decided to suspend development of this open-source project. See [this issue] for more information.**

---

**Desktop Postflop** is a free, open-source GTO solver for Texas hold'em poker.

This is a port of [WASM Postflop] to a native desktop application using the [Tauri] framework.
Since WASM Postflop works on web browsers, it is more suitable for casual use.
However, if you want to use the solver for more serious purposes, please consider trying Desktop Postflop.

## Comparison to WASM Postflop

- **Shared features**:
  - Free to use and open-source
  - Same solver engine and user interface
- **Advantages**:
  - Faster computation
  - Able to use more than 4GB of memory
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Needs to download the program and trust the execution
  - macOS builds are not distributed (you need to build the app yourself)

See the [WASM Postflop repository] for more detailed comparisons, including some commercial solvers.

## Supported environments

- OS
  - Windows: 10/11
  - macOS: 11.7 and later
    - We do not distribute macOS builds because we are not enrolled in the Apple Developer Program and cannot sign the app (please see the "Build" section below and build it yourself).
  - Linux: glibc 2.31 and later (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04 and later)
- CPU
  - x86-64: must support AVX2 instructions
    - Intel: Haswell (2013) and later
    - AMD: Zen (1st gen; 2017) and later
    - If you have a CPU without AVX2 support, you can modify `src-tauri/.cargo/config.toml` and build it yourself.
  - Apple silicon: M1 and later

## Download

You can download the app from the [GitHub releases page].

[GitHub releases page]: https://github.com/b-inary/desktop-postflop/releases

- Windows
  - The installer version (.msi) automatically installs dependent runtimes.
  - The portable version (.exe) requires the [WebView2 runtime] to be installed.
    - In most cases, the runtime should already be installed on Windows 10/11.
- Linux
  - AppImage should work on most Linux distributions.
  - Alternatively, the .deb package is available for Debian-based distributions, including Ubuntu.

## Uninstall

On Windows, please remove the following folder after the regular uninstallation to completely uninstall Desktop Postflop:

```
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\b-inary.desktop-postflop
```

## Build

[Rust] and [Node.js] (see `.nvmrc`) need to be installed to build.
On Linux, you will also need to install some dependencies; the Tauri
documentation at the time of writing is not great, but these

```sh
$ sudo apt-get install pkg-config libcairo2-dev pango1.0-tools libjavascriptcoregtk-4.0-dev libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0 libgtk-3-dev libsoup2.4-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev librsvg2-bin librsvg2-dev
```

Install the Rust nightly channel:

```sh
$ rustup install nightly
$ rustup default nightly
```

Then clone this reporitory and run the following commands:

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run tauri build
```

To debug the build process, you can use the command:

```sh
$ npm run tauri build -- --verbose
```

If the build was successful, you should be able to find the application in the `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/` directory.

If you want to use stable Rust instead of nightly Rust, please modify the following line in `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` (performance will be sacrificed):

```diff
[dependencies]
...
- postflop-solver = { git = "https://github.com/b-inary/postflop-solver", features = ["custom-alloc"] }
+ postflop-solver = { git = "https://github.com/b-inary/postflop-solver" }
```

## ~~Roadmap (in order of priority)~~

- Results saving/loading feature ([#8](https://github.com/b-inary/desktop-postflop/issues/8))
- Hand filter feature for the result viewer ([#6](https://github.com/b-inary/desktop-postflop/issues/6))
- Node-locking feature
- Short deck support
- Aggregated reporting feature for multiple flops
- GTO training mode ([#9](https://github.com/b-inary/desktop-postflop/issues/9))
